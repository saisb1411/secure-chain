# SecureChain

SecureChain is a blockchain-based system designed to explore secure data storage and transaction mechanisms in a decentralized environment.

The project demonstrates core blockchain concepts such as block creation, transaction handling, wallet interaction, and chain validation while emphasizing security and data integrity.

## Features

- Block mining and chain validation  
- Transaction management  
- Wallet support  
- REST APIs for interacting with the blockchain  
- Tamper-resistant data structure  

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript  
- Node.js  
- Express  

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the server:

npm start

The application runs locally and exposes endpoints for mining blocks, viewing the blockchain, and submitting transactions.

## Local Execution

Successfully ran the blockchain locally and verified block mining and chain growth.

## Purpose of the Project

This project was developed to gain practical understanding of blockchain architecture, distributed systems, and secure transaction design.
